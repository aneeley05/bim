# BIM
## (Bad vIM)

This is a demo project to practice and demonstrate competence in rust.

BIM is a basic command line text editor not unlike VIM or NANO.

This was my first project written in rust and is not intended to be used seriously, but do what you want with it.

(And yes, This README was written using BIM)
